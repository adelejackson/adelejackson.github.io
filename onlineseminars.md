### Online Topology Seminars (and adjacent fields)

This is a (definitely incomplete) list of topology and geometric group theory relevant seminars that are currently operating online and are open to all.
Please email me if you know of any I've missed!
These are ordered by time of day in UTC to help you figure out which ones are feasible for your time zone.
Where the time zone is not specified, it is the local time.
