I am currently working at the Machine Learning Research Group, Data61, CSIRO in Australia.
I am about to start a PhD at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford.
I am particularly interested in topology and combinatorial group theory.
I am also interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning.

### UMAP
[UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/) is a new dimension reduction technique that finds a representation with similar topological properties to the original data.
I wrote up notes on the mathematics behind UMAP, which is mostly category theory and topology, for people who have not seen much of these before.

You can download my notes on [the mathematics of UMAP](files/Maths_of_UMAP.pdf).
