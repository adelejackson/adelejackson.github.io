### Recorded talks
- March 2021, Graduate Talks in Geometry and Topology (online seminar in Australia) ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcdl9e1jyik))
- July 2021, Young Topologists Meeting ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYoG8YrVvk&list=PLsI59GhuoupLzE3rvHI8ZBaJvaISp06ox&index=17)) ([slides](/files/YTM_2021_slides.pdf))

### Notes and projects

- [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/) is a new dimension reduction technique that finds a representation with similar topological properties to the original data.
I wrote up a set of [notes on the mathematics behind UMAP](files/Maths_of_UMAP.pdf), which is mostly category theory and topology, for people who have not seen much of these before.
