I am a PhD student in the [topology group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topology) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Marc Lackenby](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lackenby/). I expect to defend my thesis in early 2024.

I am broadly interested in low-dimensional topology, geometric group theory and algorithms.
I am currently working on algorithms around Seifert fibered spaces.

My email is [firstname].[lastname]@maths.ox.ac.uk.
