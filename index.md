I am currently working at the Machine Learning Research Group, Data61, CSIRO in Australia.
I am about to start a PhD at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford.
I am particularly interested in topology and combinatorial group theory.
I am also interested in the mathematical foundations of machine learning.
